# Main-Menu-Template
A basic main menu scene and prefab, ideal to use when you need something simple for a game jam. It has audio mixer groups set up and connected. so your volume settings in the options menu will work right out of the box.

Things you may want to adjust to make the menu your own:
- PlayButton can be changed to specify which scene to go to when hitting the button. You'll find this in the button component
- Graphics can obviously be re-skinned as you need
- MenuSystem has an AudioSource added and setup to play BGM when you start the game, so you can easily load that up
- Volume sliders' parameters, such as the PlayerPref strings or slider names, can be adjusted from the prefabs
- Credits menu just has placeholder text, so don't forget to edit those, unless you feel Lorem Ipsum did a hell of a good job doing that programming

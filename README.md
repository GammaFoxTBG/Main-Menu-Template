# Main-Menu-Template
A basic main menu scene and prefab, ideal to use when you need something simple for a game jam. It has audio mixer groups set up and connected. so your volume settings in the options menu will work right out of the box.

The only thing you basically need to change is the PlayButton prefab in the MainMenu scene so you can specify which scene you want to go to when you hit the button. Past that, everthing should work as intended, and all you really need to do is just re-skin the graphics and adjust the texts as you see fit.
